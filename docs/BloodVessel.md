# BloodVessel

A BloodVessel represents a blood vessel segment in the circulatory model. It combines a volume compartment (capacitance) with flow resistance and supports autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation.

## Inheritance

```
BaseModelClass
  └── Capacitance          (volume, elastance, pressure)
        └── BloodCapacitance   (blood composition: O2, CO2, solutes, drugs, temperature)
              └── BloodVessel  (resistance, flow, ANS coupling)
```

## What it models

A BloodVessel is both a **capacitance** (it holds a volume of blood at a certain pressure) and a **resistance** (blood flows through it with a pressure drop). Each BloodVessel creates one or more internal `Resistor` objects based on its `inputs` list. These resistors handle the actual flow calculations between upstream components and this vessel.

When the ANS changes vascular tone, the vessel's resistance **and** elastance change simultaneously. This coupling is governed by the `alpha` parameter and is a distinguishing feature of the Explain model.

## Initialization

During `init_model()`, the BloodVessel creates a `Resistor` instance for each entry in its `inputs` array. Each resistor is named `{inputName}_{vesselName}` (e.g., `AA_AD1`) and is registered in the model engine. Each step the BloodVessel overwrites their `r_for`/`r_back`/`r_k` with its own effective values (see [Owned input resistors](#owned-input-resistors)).

If a resistor already exists in the model engine (e.g., when loading from a saved state), the existing instance is reused.

## Calculation cycle (`calc_model`)

Each model step executes in this order:

1. **`calc_resistances()`** -- compute effective forward, backward, and non-linear resistances
2. **`calc_elastances()`** -- compute effective elastance with ANS and resistance-elastance coupling
3. **Update resistors** -- push the calculated values to all internal `Resistor` objects
4. **`calc_volumes()`** -- compute effective unstressed volume (inherited from Capacitance)
5. **`calc_pressure()`** -- compute recoil (`pres_in`) and total pressure (inherited from Capacitance)
7. **`get_flows()`** -- sum forward and backward flows from all internal resistors

## Three-tier factor system

Each physical property can be modulated by three independent factor tiers. All factors default to 1.0 (no change).

**Composition differs by property.** `BloodVessel` **overrides** `calc_resistances()` and `calc_elastances()`, so its resistance (`r_for`/`r_back`/`r_k`) and elastance (`el_base`/`el_k`) tiers compose **multiplicatively** (the product of the three factors, plus the ANS multiplier for `r`/`el`):

```
value_eff = base * factor * factor_ps * factor_scaling_ps   # r_for, r_back, r_k, el_base, el_k
```

Multiplicative composition lets simultaneous factors compound correctly: `r_factor = 2` with `r_factor_ps = 2` gives a true 4× rise, not the linearised 3× the additive form produces.

The unstressed volume `u_vol` is **not** overridden — it is computed by the inherited `Capacitance.calc_volumes()`, which is still **additive** (matching the base-class convention):

```
u_vol_eff = u_vol
  + (u_vol_factor - 1) * u_vol             # tier 1: non-persistent
  + (u_vol_factor_ps - 1) * u_vol          # tier 2: persistent
  + (u_vol_factor_scaling_ps - 1) * u_vol  # tier 3: scaling
```

### Tier 1: Non-persistent factors (reset every step)

| Factor | Affects |
|---|---|
| `el_base_factor` | `el_base` |
| `el_k_factor` | `el_k` |
| `u_vol_factor` | `u_vol` |
| `r_factor` | `r_for`, `r_back` |
| `r_k_factor` | `r_k` |

These are set by other models during a step (e.g., the breathing model applying intrathoracic pressure effects) and automatically reset to 1.0 after use (`r_factor`/`r_k_factor` in `calc_resistances`, `el_base_factor`/`el_k_factor` in `calc_elastances`, `u_vol_factor` in `calc_volumes`).

### Tier 2: Persistent factors (`_ps`)

| Factor | Affects |
|---|---|
| `el_base_factor_ps` | `el_base` |
| `el_k_factor_ps` | `el_k` |
| `u_vol_factor_ps` | `u_vol` |
| `r_factor_ps` | `r_for`, `r_back` |
| `r_k_factor_ps` | `r_k` |

These persist across steps and are used by controllers like the ANS or Heart model to apply ongoing physiological modulation.

### Tier 3: Scaling factors (`_scaling_ps`)

| Factor | Affects |
|---|---|
| `el_base_factor_scaling_ps` | `el_base` |
| `el_k_factor_scaling_ps` | `el_k` |
| `u_vol_factor_scaling_ps` | `u_vol` |
| `r_factor_scaling_ps` | `r_for`, `r_back` |
| `r_k_factor_scaling_ps` | `r_k` |

These are used exclusively by the `ModelScaler` for weight-based or manual scaling. Having a dedicated tier means scaling does not interfere with physiological factors in tier 2. (Note the `_scaling_ps` suffix — capacitance/resistor/elastance scaling factors all carry it; this differs from the diffusor/exchanger models, whose scaling factors are bare `*_factor_scaling`.)

## ANS and resistance-elastance coupling

The ANS influences both resistance and elastance, but through different pathways:

### Resistance

ANS modulates resistance directly, scaled by sensitivity. The ANS contribution is a sensitivity-weighted multiplier `ans_mult = 1 + (ans_activity - 1) * ans_sens`, composed multiplicatively with the three resistance-factor tiers:

```
ans_mult       = 1 + (ans_activity - 1) * ans_sens
r_total_factor = r_factor * r_factor_ps * r_factor_scaling_ps * ans_mult

r_for_eff = r_for * r_total_factor
r_back_eff = r_back * r_total_factor
```

`r_k` carries its own factor stack with the same ANS coupling: `r_k_eff = r_k · r_k_factor · r_k_factor_ps · r_k_factor_scaling_ps · ans_mult`. The combined `r_total_factor` is cached and reused by the elastance step (single source of truth for the α-coupling).

### Elastance (alpha coupling)

When a vessel constricts (resistance increases), its wall also becomes stiffer (elastance increases). The `alpha` parameter controls how strongly resistance changes translate into elastance changes via a power law applied **once** to the *combined* resistance multiplier `r_total_factor` (which already folds in the ANS contribution):

```
el_passive_mult = el_base_factor * el_base_factor_ps * el_base_factor_scaling_ps
el_geom_mult    = r_total_factor ^ alpha            # α-coupling to resistance

el_eff = el_base * el_passive_mult * el_geom_mult
```

`el_k` is **not** α-coupled — the non-linear stiffening term is treated as a structural property of the wall, so it carries only its own passive multipliers:

```
el_k_eff = el_k * el_k_factor * el_k_factor_ps * el_k_factor_scaling_ps
```

Typical alpha values:
- **Large arteries**: 0.5 (moderate coupling)
- **Arterioles**: 0.63 (stronger coupling)
- **Veins/venules**: 0.75 (strongest coupling)

An alpha of 0.0 means resistance changes have no effect on elastance.

## Owned input resistors

Each step `calc_model` writes the vessel's `r_for_eff`/`r_back_eff`/`r_k_eff` into the **base** `r_for`/`r_back`/`r_k` of every input resistor (plus `no_flow`, `no_back_flow`, `p1_ext`, `p2_ext`, `is_enabled`). Two consequences:

- **The resistor's own factor stack still applies on top.** `Resistor.calc_resistance` multiplies that base by its own `r_factor`/`r_factor_ps`/`r_factor_scaling_ps` (additively). Models that need to change one input without touching the vessel use this layer, and the vessel's `r_for_eff` does **not** show it. In `term_neonate`: `Kidneys` writes `KID_CAP_KID_VEN.r_factor_ps` (efferent arteriole), and `Brain` writes `AA_BR_ART.r_factor_ps` (cerebral autoregulation). `ModelScaler` never scales an owned resistor (the scaler groups list the vessels), so nothing is scaled twice.
- **One lag step.** In a loaded scenario the owned resistors are top-level entries, so they step before their vessel and use the values the vessel wrote in the previous step.

`flow`/`flow_forward`/`flow_backward` are summed over the vessel's **input** resistors: `flow` is the net inflow into this vessel, not its outflow.

## Pressure calculation

Pressure is calculated by the inherited `Capacitance.calc_pressure()`:

```
pres_in = el_k_eff * (vol - u_vol_eff)^2 + el_eff * (vol - u_vol_eff)
pres    = pres_in + pres_ext
```

Where `pres_ext` is a non-persistent external pressure (e.g., intrathoracic pressure) that resets to 0 each step.

## Usage in the model hierarchy

- **Standalone**: Used for large arteries (AA, AD1, AD2) and veins (IVCI, SVCI) that are directly defined in the model.
- **Inside Heart (indirectly)**: Heart valves use standalone `Resistor` objects that connect HeartChamber components, not BloodVessels.
