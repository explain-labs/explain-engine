# Explain Engine — Model Documentation Index

This directory documents the **Explain physiological simulation engine** (the framework-agnostic
ES modules under `explain/`, not the Vue/UI layer). Each model class and engine helper has its own
reference doc; this page is the map.

**New here?** Start with **[ARCHITECTURE](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** — the whole-model developer overview
(two-thread design, message protocol, build/step loop, the cross-cutting patterns every model uses,
and how to add a new model). Then dive into the per-class docs below.

Each per-class doc follows the same house template (see the template section in
[ARCHITECTURE](./ARCHITECTURE.md)): summary → inheritance → what it models → property tables →
calculation/math → factor system → example JSON → usage. The exemplar is
[BloodCapacitance](./BloodCapacitance.md).

> **Cross-cutting footgun:** the factor/effective-value scaling tier is **not uniformly named**.
> The capacitance/resistor/time-varying-elastance family uses `*_factor_scaling_ps`, but the
> diffusor/exchanger family (`GasDiffusor`, `GasExchanger`, `BloodDiffusor`) uses `*_factor_scaling`
> (no `_ps`). See [ARCHITECTURE §cross-cutting patterns](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Architecture & contract

| Doc | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [ARCHITECTURE](./ARCHITECTURE.md) | Whole-model overview: threads, wire protocol, build/step loop, cross-cutting patterns, how to add a model, the doc template. |

## Formats & developer workflow

| Doc | What it covers |
|---|---|
